## POSDAO Initial Security Audit by PepperSec

**Completed**: August 2019

**Conclusion**: All issues fixed or addressed. Due to scalability concerns, teams created a new methodology to accumulate and later “pull” their stakes and rewards instead of the “push” strategy as implemented in the audited version of the contracts.

**Contracts:** Version 0.1.0 addresses issues present in audit. [https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.1.0](https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
