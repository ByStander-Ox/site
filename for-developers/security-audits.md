When audited, the working name for the staking token was DPOS. This has since changed to STAKE. Additional minor changes have been made since the previous audit. We have conducted internal audits on these changes and an additional outside audit is in process.

## POSDAO Initial Security Audit by PepperSec

**Completed**: August 2019

**Conclusion**: All issues fixed or addressed. Due to scalability concerns, teams created a new methodology to accumulate and later “pull” their stakes and rewards instead of the “push” strategy as implemented in the audited version of the contracts.

**Contracts:** Version 0.1.0 addresses issues present in audit. [https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.1.0](https://github.com/poanetwork/posdao-contracts/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
