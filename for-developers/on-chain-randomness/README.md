# On-Chain Randomness

We are introducing an on-chain RNG based on RANDAO. It may also be leveraged by smart contract developers to introduce random numbers into their applications.

* [How to access the random seed in a smart contract](accessing-a-random-seed-in-a-smart-contract.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The POSDAO implementation will require randomness when it launches. [This article describes how randomness will work on POSDAO,  including an interactive example.](https://forum.poa.network/t/reliable-randomness-bringing-on-chain-entropy-to-the-xdai-stable-chain/3015)
