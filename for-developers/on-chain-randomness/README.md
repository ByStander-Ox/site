# On-Chain Randomness

The new POSDAO implementation will include a RNG based on RANDAO. This is needed for validator selection, but may also be leveraged by smart contract developers to introduce random numbers into their applications. 

[This article describes how randomness will work on POSDAO,  including an interactive example.](https://forum.poa.network/t/reliable-randomness-bringing-on-chain-entropy-to-the-xdai-stable-chain/3015)
