# EXIT FAQs

### How do I get EXIT

EXIT will be available through a token swap process, accessible through 1inch.exchange. The initial swap pairs will likely be DAI/EXIT and STAKE/EXIT.

### How much EXIT will be available?

In phase 1, issuance will be determined based on liquidity needs and interest in the Liquidity Provider program. In phase 2, a DAO will determine the policies associated with issuance.

### Will EXIT be offered for sale by any exchanges?

Not through any centralized exchanges, but EXIT will be available to swap on decentralized exchanges \(DEXs\) as the market determines there is a value in this.

### **How does EXIT remain pegged at 1:1 to the US Dollar?**

The amount of soft ETH in the reward contract provides the backing to support a stable valuation. For every $1 USD of EXIT that is minted,  $2 USD worth of soft ETH is also added. The provides a large cushion to support fluctuating ETH prices.

### **Why is soft Ether needed?**

Soft Ether provides a virtual overcollateralization method for creating the Stable EXIT coin. Since it is always at a 2:1 ratio \(there is 200% of soft Ether relative to EXIT in the reward contract\) the price of Ether can rise or fall dramatically without impacting the price of EXIT. When the price does rise or fall, the rebalancing feature maintains the ratio.

### How does rebalancing work?

On an daily \(configurable\) basis, the contract calls an oracle which provides the current ETH price, and this price is inherited by soft ETH. If the price has dropped, more soft ETH is minted to match the 2:1 ratio. If the price has increased, the excess soft ETH is burned to maintain the same ratio.

### How do I use EXIT? What is it used for?

EXIT is an algorithmically derived commodity, it's value and usage will be determined by the marketplace.  The initial use case is to create an EXIT/STAKE liquidity pool and receive STAKE rewards as benefits for  maintaining this pool.

As an ERC20 token, EXIT can be traded on DEXs, sent to wallets, used as a means of trade, and accommodate any other ERC20 functionality.
