# Pre-Staking Program

## Pre-Staking on BitMax

StakeVault is an innovative brand-new ****program ****offered by BitMax. It allows projects to refine crypto-economic designs while regular token holders can participate in simulated staking prior to public rollout. Participants earn real rewards and projects fine-tune their infrastructure through an incentivized testnet. 

{% hint style="success" %}
**STAKE is the first token to launch on this platform!**
{% endhint %}

## **How it Works**

Participants lock tokens using StakeVault in a simulated staking environment. For xDai, this means 1 week staking epochs. With public staking, tokens will be locked in the protocol during that time. However, StakeVault offers the opportunity for users to unstake at any time, with instant unbonding.

STAKE rewards are provided to users at a predetermined rate. With pre-staking this is **36.4% APR**. When public staking begins, [rewards on xDai are 15% APR, with additional reward opportunities](../stake-reward-mechanics/rewards-in-a-dual-token-environment.md). The program continues for 3 months, providing participants with the opportunity to earn STAKE rewards as the protocol prepares for public validation and staking.

With pre-staking,  every 1000 STAKE placed in StakeVault equals 1 STAKE/day in rewards.

When open public staking starts, users may continue to use StakeVault or may choose to use the xDai user interface for staking and delegated staking.
