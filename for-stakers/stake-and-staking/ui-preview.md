# UI Preview

The xDai staking UI is currently under construction.  It will be incorporated directly into the [xDai block explorer BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai). This will provide users with the ability to easily stake, withdraw, move and claim STAKE and view transactions all from a single interface.  

{% hint style="info" %}
Block times, staking epochs, and staking amounts are all modified to enable faster testing iterations. Parameters will be updated in the live environment.

Transactions times were not altered, and take between 5-10 seconds for confirmation.
{% endhint %}
