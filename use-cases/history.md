# Features of xDai

## Native Stable Coin

A stable coin provides peace of mind. Predictable currencies allow buyers and sellers to exchange value without the risks of volatility. In the xDai Stable Chain implementation, transactions are conducted using xDai, a stable coin pegged one-to-one with Dai. Because transactions occur on a bridged sidechain, they are extremely fast and inexpensive.

## DPOS Consensus

xDai Stable Chain brings delegated Proof of Stake \(DPOS\) to Ethereum. The white paper describes all aspects of this new consensus protocol, called POSDAO consensus, including a complete overview of the theory, rationale, security, and a detailed implementation section.

### Bridges to Ethereum

Two bridges connect xDai Stable Chain to the Ethereum mainnet, supporting seamless two-way asset transfer between chains. Tokens are acquired on the mainnet, then bridged to the xDai Stable Chain sidechain using either the Dai-xDai bridge for transactional tokens, or the DPOS bridge for staking tokens. Once a user is finished transacting or staking, tokens can be bridged back to the mainnet with ease.
