# Peer-to-Peer Payments

With xDai, sending money to a friend, relative or vendor is fast, cheap and easy. Itâ€™s also stable, as the value of xDai closely follows the US dollar. Peer-to-peer \(P2P\) payments on the blockchain can replace the current expensive, slow, bank-driven processes that dominate online payment systems today. Itâ€™s already happening - the case studies below highlight xDai P2P in action.
