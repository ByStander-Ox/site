# Stable Platform for Smart Contracts

When transaction fees and speeds are a known quantity, developers can plan and execute accordingly. A more responsive UX, micropayments, and predictable cross-chain interactions are all achievable in a stable ecosystem.

### Smart Contract Case Study

The [Helena Network](https://media.consensys.net/prediction-markets-platform-becomes-first-dapp-on-xdai-sidechain-f26e6d691799) is a prediction market that runs on the xDai Chain. Daily transactions are conducted on the xDai chain to keep gas fees low, and data is synced with the Ethereum mainnet on a regular basis.
