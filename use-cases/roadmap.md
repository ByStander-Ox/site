# Roadmap

![xDai roadmap for 2019 and 2020](../.gitbook/assets/xdai-roadmap.png)

## Consensus Upgrade

**Target Date:** Q1 2020 

xDai currently uses known organizations in the ecosystem as chain validators. These organizations subsidize their own nodes, and this is unsustainable in the long term. To increase decentralization, and offer the broader community the chance to participate in consensus, we will upgrade to the POSDAO consensus model in the near future. 

## **Privacy preserving transactions**

**Target Date:** Q4 2019

Implementation of additional zero-knowledge protocols and private transactions into xDai. 

Since xDai is a stable token, the primary use of the chain is peer-to-peer payments. Just as with cash, privacy should be an option when exchanging money or paying vendors for services. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are sending money to a relative or your local butcher. You should have the freedom to choose that any transaction remain anonymous.

We have invested in several [different approaches ](https://forum.poa.network/t/introducing-the-poa-zero-knowledge-fund/2698)to implement different ZK protocols into xDai based applications and wallets.

## **Multi-Collateral Dai &lt;-&gt; xDai Bridge**

**Target Date:** Q4 2019 \(based on MakerDAO progress\)

Once the Dai protocol implementation is upgraded to MCD \(Multi-Collateral Dai\), the xDai bridge will also be upgraded to use MCD Dai.
