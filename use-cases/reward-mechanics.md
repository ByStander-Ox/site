# Reward Mechanics

When the xDai DPOS protocol starts, a large seed amount of DAI is locked in the bridge \(and converted to xDai in the protocol\). This locked DAI is provisioned to a lending mechanism where it accumulates interest, and this interest in turn provides staking rewards.

The amount of locked DAI will determine the maximum amount of STAKE that can be placed in the protocol. Max STAKE amount in USD will be considerably less than the total locked DAI amount. However, incentives for staking pools will be calculated based on **interest from the total amount of DAI locked in the protocol**. This difference between the amount of locked DAI and the amount of STAKE provides the opportunity for higher staking rewards.

Staking rewards will be paid in xDai, creating a **stable reward mechanism**. Validators and delegators will have the opportunity to earn stable incentives on their stake at much higher rates than current DeFi lending interest amounts.
