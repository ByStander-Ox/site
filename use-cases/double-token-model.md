  with a specific purpose

# Double Token Model

## xDai Token

The xDai token is a stable currency used for transactions on the xDai Stable chain. xDai is created through the TokenBridge mechanism, where DAI is locked in a smart contract and the same amount of xDai is minted on the xDai chain. When a user bridges xDai back to DAI, the xDai is burned and the DAI is unlocked. For this reason, xDaiâ€™s value always corresponds 1:1 with DAI.

## STAKE Token

STAKE is a new ERC20 token designed to secure the on-chain payment layer and provide a mechanism for stable POS incentives. Users \(validators and delegators\) provide STAKE as collateral when participating in the consensus process. In exchange for providing STAKE \(and supporting a node\), users [receive rewards in xDai](reward-mechanics.md), a stable token. The initial use case described below covers the xDai Stable chain, but other chains may use STAKE as well \(multichain staking\).More coming soon
