# xDai Validators



![](../../.gitbook/assets/a3ef25ecb561eeac91e55cb02e9b30fda191479b.jpeg)

In our recent [history of xDai](https://forum.poa.network/t/xdai-the-birth-of-the-stable-chain/2812) post, we discussed the origins of the xDai Stable Chain. When it began, xDai was highly centralized - in fact POA Network was the one and only validator! This immediately shifted as several new validators were introduced, and POA Network’s on-chain governance model brought further decentralization to the protocol.

A set of [on-chain governance tools](https://voting.poa.network) allows current validators to propose and elect new validators as they see fit. Validator candidates introduce themselves and make their case for becoming a new validator, the current validators discuss their merits and ask questions, and if they decide to proceed, a vote is proposed to add the new validator to the protocol. Over the past year, 9 new validators have been added to the xDai Stable chain, bringing the total to 10 validators responsible for securing the chain.

xDai stable chain validators have multiple responsibilities, including providing secure transactional consensus and managing network decisions. When DAI from Ethereum is bridged to xDAI and back, a subset of validators ensure these transactions are conducted properly and securely in a non-custodial, decentralized fashion.

As we prepare to upgrade the xDai Stable Chain to the new [POSDAO](https://forum.poa.network/t/posdao-white-paper/2208) consensus model, the current xDai validators will become the initial staking validators for this delegated Proof-of-Stake model. Their nodes are currently optimized for the protocol, and their experience providing consensus will be invaluable at the start. Any individual who holds **$DPOS** may stake and delegate on these validators. Once the chain is up and running, additional entities may establish their own nodes and register as new validator candidates according to the rules of the protocol.

Following the first staking epoch, which will last one week \(each staking epoch is one week in length\), a new validator set will be selected. Validator candidates with the largest pools \(consisting of their own stake + stake from any delegators\) will have a higher chance of selection to the next epoch. Validator set selection occurs for each new staking epoch.

The xDai stable chain upgrade to POSDAO consensus is designed to achieve [greater decentralization](https://xdaichain.com/). With this upgrade, two tokens will be connected through interoperability bridges. The xDai token will continue as the native stable coin, and **$DPOS** will be added as the multichain staking token. **$DPOS** will first be available for staking on the xDai stable chain, but it will also function across multiple networks. Each time a new xDai-based chain is created and established, the **$DPOS** token will be used for staking. The introduction of multiple tokens, along with delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus, promotes further decentralization and censorship resistance on the xDai chain.

The [ten current validators](https://forum.poa.network/c/xdai-chain/validators-intro) of the xDai stable chain are introduced below:

### [POA Network](http://www.poa.network)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/a6aa7588a0d8fec1841a9e93183ab35317bb778f.png)

As the Master of Ceremony of the xDai Stable Chain, POA Network is the first validator and the network initiator. POA Network builds infrastructure and tools for the Ethereum ecosystem focused on both users and developers. With the xDai Stable Chain, POA Network has created a peer-to-peer payment solution on Ethereum that is easy, fast, predictable, and extremely inexpensive. _“We created xDai as a stablecoin-based blockchain to open up endless possibilities for developers and applications. With the introduction of_ [_POSDAO_](https://forum.poa.network/t/posdao-white-paper/2208) _consensus we are adding a higher level of decentralization to xDai and introducing multichain staking on Ethereum”_ -- [**Igor Barinov**](https://twitter.com/barinov)**, Tech Lead of POA Network.**

### [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com)

MakerDAO is an autonomous blockchain organization that offers a decentralized stablecoin to minimize market volatility. Its stablecoin, Dai, is pegged to the U.S. Dollar and is backed by Ethereum collateral. _“MakerDAO was one of the first xDai Validators because we believe in the value of a blockchain where the underlying token is Dai, providing stable and predictable prices for its gas use. In addition, the xDai chain has given birth to some amazing projects such as the Burner Wallet, which we've seen first hand can be used to onboard and delight new users to Ethereum. We look forward to seeing further adoption in the future.”_ [**Mariano Conti**](https://twitter.com/nanexcool) **- Head of Smart Contracts**. In addition to Dai, MakerDAO has issued Maker \(MKR\) tokens which are used to govern the ongoing initiatives within the MakerDAO organization.

It builds sustainable blockchain enabled energy and mobility solutions towards an open, fair and ethical sharing economy. _"My first encounter with xDai was a transfer via Burner Wallet onto my mobile phone and I immediately liked the simplicity and speed of it. It is great to be part of this well known group of validators to secure the xDai sidechain and push the limits for staking and consensus algorithms."_ -- [**Thomas Zeinzinger**](https://twitter.com/tze42)**, Boardmember of the lab10 collective.**

The xDai Stable Chain is widely acknowledged by the community as an immediately available scaling solution and peer-to-peer payment platform. The POSDAO update will provide additional decentralization, and present the opportunity for many more individuals to become involved in the consensus process through delegated staking.

The ten validators highlighted above will serve as the initial validators when the network transitions to the POSDAO model. Community delegators will be able to participate by placing stake on these validators. We are extremely excited for delegated and multichain staking, and look forward to the positive changes and innovations it brings to the ecosystem as a whole!

In our next post, we will explore the xDai infrastructure starting with the wallets that currently support xDai. Wallets are a key user interface, and they address real world problems and unique use cases on the xDai stable chain. We will discuss features, functionality, and what you can expect from supported wallets with the POSDAO upgrade.
