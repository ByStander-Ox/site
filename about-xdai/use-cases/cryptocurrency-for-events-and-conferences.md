# Cryptocurrency for Events & Conferences

xDai has proven itself as a go-to solution for transactions and real-world crypto-based interactions at live events. These include intimate gatherings like the [Cypherpunk Speakeasies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/decentralized-cypherpunk-speakeasy-2fdbdc446318) pioneered by Austin Griffith, to the recent [Splunk19 Conference](https://conf.splunk.com/) which hosted over 25,000 wallets.

## Ethereum Conferences

In 2019, EthDenver provided the first large-scale usage of the xDai chain and xDai currency. Food trucks at the event accepted BuffiDai as payment \(an erc20 created on the xDai chain\), and after parties accepted cryptocurrency for beer and vendor swag. See the [peer-to-peer payments post ](peer-to-peer-payments.md)for much more!

Since that event, many EthConferences have adopted a similar model for their conferences. Usage has expanded to include NFT interaction, goods and services purchases, and registration for events to earn additional conference tokens.

## Splunk Conference \(Non-Crypto Conference\)

The [Splunk .conf19](https://conf.splunk.com/) is the biggest event to date powered by xDai, with over 25,000 participants! This non-crypto event introduced many new people to the world of cryptocurrency with their ButterCup Bucks token.  This includes multiple thousands of dollars raised for charity.
