# Community Currencies

Community currencies \(CCs\) are local money used to pay for goods and services within a community.  CCs are complementary to the national currency, providing a medium for daily spending and trade, reserving national currency \(which can be volatile or scarce\) for savings and interaction with larger institutions. 

CCs support and empower communities to create jobs, develop social programs, and support trade by creating a decentralized, local banking infrastructure. In addition to local communities, initiatives led by [Grassroots Economics, Sempo, the Red Cross and Bancor are bringing CCs to refugee camps and other disaster-prone communities.](https://af.reuters.com/article/kenyaNews/idAFL8N28231Q)

Blockchain technology supports CCs by providing a transparent web-based platform for local currency exchange. [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) is leveraging the xDai chain to manage currency trading within and among communities in Kenya. Local currencies can be traded with one another based on bonding curves - all users need is a mobile phone and a [Bancor ](https://www.bancor.network/)wallet. The speed, stability \(transaction fees are low and known\), and reliability of the xDai Chain are providing the infrastructure needed for local digital currencies to thrive.
