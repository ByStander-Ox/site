# Projects & DApps

One of the advantages of the xDai Network is 100% compatibility with Ethereum. Any DApp deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet can be deployed on xDai with minimal changes. Developers and projects are realizing they can easily deploy and/or migrate to xDai to realize big cost savings and escape congestion.  Forks of popular projects can also deploy on xDai to take advantage of the stable network mechanics. Applications can live in multiple places at once, serving different audiences and experimenting with different use-cases.

### Examples of Projects/Dapps deployed to xDai include:

* [1Hive](1hive.md): DAO with a Community Currency & DEX on xDai
  * [Uniswap v1 Fork](https://uniswap.1hive.org/swap): Deployed by 1Hive, provides liquidity with a DEX on xDAI.
  * [Aragon Connect](https://1hive.org/): Deployed by 1Hive, provides DAO governance and proposal functionality.
* [xMoon Exchange](https://xmoon.exchange/): A DEX for Reddit MOON liquidity \(xMoon to xDai\)
* [Grassroots Economics](../use-cases/community-currencies.md):  Community Currencies in Kenya
* [Galt Project](../use-cases/dao-governance.md): DAO governance, UBI
* [KickBack](https://medium.com/wearekickback/kickback-x-the-three-experimental-new-features-bb75e1149022): Event Management and RSVP accountability
