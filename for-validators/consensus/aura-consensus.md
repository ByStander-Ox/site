# AuRa Consensus

xDai currently uses Parity's AuRa \(Authority Round\) proof-of-authority consensus model to append blocks to the xDai chain. In this model, selected validators take turns signing blocks. A signed block is broadcast to all validators, and if the majority agree it is valid, it is added to the chain. A new block is added every 5 seconds, regardless of whether any transactions occurred during that time.
