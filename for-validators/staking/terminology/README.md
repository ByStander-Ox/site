# Terminology

The POSDAO staking algorithm introduces many concepts and terms. Find links to common terms below. Terms are subdivided into 3 categories:

**Protocol:** Terms related to the underlying POSDAO protocol such as reward mechanism, emissions, bridge functionality and protocol rules.

**Participant:** Terms related to consensus keepers - candidates, validators and delegators who protect the chain.

**Operational:** Terms related to actions a participant might take when adding, moving or removing stake. Also relates to terminology in the UI such as stakes ratio and balances.
