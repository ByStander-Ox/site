# About xDai Validators

The xDai Stable Chain is protected by a select group of validators well known in the Ethereum space. For a complete and updated list, visit [https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators](https://validators.poa.network/poa-dapps-validators). Make sure your web3 interface \(ie MetaMask, Nifty Wallet\) is set to the xDai chain \(RPC URL = [https://dai.poa.network](https://dai.poa.network), network ID = 100\)

To learn more about the Validators, [visit our forum section where validators introduce themselves ](https://forum.poa.network/c/xdai-chain/validators-intro)and explain why they want to validate the chain.

When xDai switches to dPOS, anyone with enough STAKE and the ability to run a node can become a candidate. Candidates will be eligible to become validators in the new model.
