# xDai Dev Team

Igor Barinov is the tech and operations lead and has been involved with Ethereum based projects for quite a long time -  he is an original founder of the [POA Network](http://poa.network). With POA Network he created an Ethereum sidechain with a Proof-of-Autonomy consensus, where all validators are United States Notary publics. The network is largely autonomous now, the validators run the chain, but we also created a strong R&D focus at POA, and the team has been building a robust open-source explorer called [BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai), which is now the primary explorer for Ethereum Classic. They also built [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/), which provides interoperability between different blockchains. These efforts have all come together to produce the xDai Stable Chain.

Additional xDai project team leaders include Vadim Arasev \(POSDAO team lead\), Victor Barinov \(BlockScout + Nifty Wallet integrations\) Alex Kolotov \(TokenBridge\), Max Alekseenko \(Decentralized App development\) & Andrew Gross \(technical writer\). Their experience spans not only blockchain development but each brings a unique perspective from fields such as telecommunications, robotics, ecommerce, informatics, genetics and research.
