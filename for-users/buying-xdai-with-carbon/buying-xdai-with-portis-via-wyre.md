# Buying xDai with Portis via Carbon

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your billing address is located in the U.S., Wyre is used to purchase xDai via the Portis wallet. If outside the US, you will use [Carbon](../buying-xdai-with-wyre/buying-xdai-with-portis.md) to buy xDai in the Portis wallet.

Carbon and Wyre have different requirements and limits per user and per day.
