# Burner Wallet 2

{% hint style="success" %}
**UPDATE: Burner Wallet 2 is the latest recipient of the** [**xDAi Adoption Fund**](../../for-developers/grants/#xdai-adoption-fund)**!** We've provided a $ 5,000 DAI grant to David Mihal to continue development on this tool, including a plugin that will make fiat -&gt; xDai conversion a simple process, and a second plugin to support sending and receiving xDai through LinkDrop.   
{% endhint %}

**Wallet Type**: [Web Wallet](https://xdai.io)

**Description:** The Burner Wallet 2 is the continuation of Austin Griffith's groundbreaking original Burner Wallet. When first revealed at ETHDenver, the Burner Wallet inspired many developers to rethink how blockchain applications are built.

The Burner Wallet 2 follows many of the original design patterns of the Burner Wallet, but rebuilds them as a set of libraries that are stable, modular and extendable. Our goal is to make this project as developer-friendly as possible, empowering developers to build custom wallets and extend functionality by building plugins.

The Burner Wallet 2 has already powered a number of great events, such as the [Escape Room at ETHBerlin](https://medium.com/@dmihal/bringing-the-burner-wallet-to-ethberlins-escape-room-5d2d01992962), and a [happy hour at ETHBoston](https://twitter.com/dmihal/status/1169999226237009920). And there's much more on the horizon for the wallet, with upcoming events at Devcon and ETHWaterloo, and a number of Burner Wallet plugins from companies like Helena, Ching and Sablier.

**Burner Factory:** The Burner Factory is a complimentary application to the Burner Wallet. Burner Factory allows anyone to build a custom "burner experience" without writing a single line of code. The current site allows customizing the set of tokens and exchange pairs included in a wallet, and quickly deploying that wallet to a server. However, features will be launching soon to power the creation of new tokens, generation of paper wallets, and more!
