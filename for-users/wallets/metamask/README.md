# Metamask

**Wallet Type**: Web3 wallet: Extensions available for [Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more](https://metamask.io/)

**Description**:  MetaMask is the original web3 wallet. It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node. See our [Metamask Setup instructions](metamask-setup.md) to start using with xDai.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Nifty Wallet and MetaMask do not function properly when both are activated at the same time as chrome extensions. To use one or the other, **right click** on the extension icon, go to **Manage Extensions**, and **toggle off/on** the application you want to use. All data will be preserved in the wallet for future access.
{% endhint %}
